### Application Chart

The Application Chart, found at the top of the home screen, is built using the ChartJS librariy. It sorts data of days since the user has signed up in the x-axis and applications sent on each of those days in the y-axis. This is all shown in the blue chart on image 1 above. Finally, this chart is overlayn ontop of a data set of sent application frequency of other users. Depicted by the gray chart in the same image.
